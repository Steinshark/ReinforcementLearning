# ReinforcementLearning

This is my reinforcement learning personal project ~ just a dabble into the concept. I plan to implement an RL algorithm and implement various games. Currently, Snake is the only game I have in progress. The algorithm learns off of a 3 channel input image for each game, so its utility can be extrapolated to any arbitrary game whos state can be represented in an image.
